## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What motivated me to create this project is my desire to become a great coder. In order to do so, I will need to maximize all of my resources and a huge part of that is organizing the information that I obtain in my coding bootcamp course.
- Creating a study guide is a great way to have organized and concise material at your finger tips to reference in order to become well versed in any subject.
- The first problem solved by developing my own study guide is gathering valuable information in a convenient place and the second is taking advantage of an opportunity to practice coding.
- I have learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
